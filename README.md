# What's with the skin?

Server_Protector's skin was one of our team members' first skin in Minecraft, dating back to 1.4.6

# Is this legal?

Yes. Everything we do is completely legal and within our rights as an anti-griefing group. We are in full compliance with the Minecraft EULA, Minecraft Usage Guidelines, Xbox Community Standards, and all other relevant rules and regulations.

“To keep the Minecraft community welcoming and inclusive for everyone, we have a zero-tolerance policy towards hate speech, terrorist or violent extremist content, bullying, harassing, sexual solicitation, fraud, or threatening others.”

Griefing, harassment, and abuse have no place in Minecraft. Playing with others should be safe and inclusive, and we take action when that safety is threatened.

Content that involves hate speech, violent threats, harassment, bullying, sexual solicitation, fraud, or encouragement of illegal activity is strictly prohibited under Minecraft’s guidelines. Builds, mods, skins, and chat behavior that promote harm or extreme bias are also not allowed.

Despite this, so-called “renovation” groups like The Fifth Column and MLPI (which stands for "Mojang Loss Prevention Inc", even though its members have been banned from multiplayer by Mojang in the past) falsely claim to follow the EULA while openly violating it by harrasing and destroying random servers, often those of young players who don’t know how to protect them. These groups justify griefing as "education" or "stopping piracy". In reality, they’re trying to rank up in private Discords by destroying as many servers as possible, leaving behind signs with Discord invites, and mocking server owners. 

Our community focuses on education and awareness about these violations. We do not profit from these activities - we act solely to promote fair play, protect builds, and prevent abuse before it causes harm.

# How do you find servers?
We believe the best defense is preventative. CobbleGuard uses similar technology to the groups mentioned above, but for a benevolent purpose. Our automated bots perform a simple, non-intrusive check, and send messages warning unprotected servers. Our process is harmless, respectful, and helpful. We don't break blocks, we don't spam, and we certainly don't destroy. We are an early warning system for the community.

# xxx joined my server. Was this you?
Our only Minecraft accounts currently in use are **Server_Protector** and **PutOnWhitelist**.

# How can I protect my server?
If your server is meant to be private, there are a few things you can do.

1. Use online-mode
  This is by far the most important protection mechanism. If your server is running in offline-mode, anyone can join with any username, including as an operator, even if whitelist is enabled. To stop this, you should set the server to online-mode.
  If you don't own a copy of the game and are able to purchase one, you can use the funds paying for your server to buy an account instead, and play multiplayer using a mod like [e4mc (reccomended)](https://modrinth.com/mod/e4mc) (available via modrinth) or [Essential (available via modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/essential) [or via their installer)](https://essential.gg/downloads).
  If you aren't able to purchase a copy of the game (e.g. due to sanctions in your country), you can use a plugin like [AuthMeReloaded](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authmereloaded.6269/) (available on SpigotMC), so players need to set a password and enter it every time they log on. This combined with a whitelist will stop malicious players from joining your server)

2. Enable whitelist
  With a whitelist in place, only users admins manually add are able to join and play on the server.
  You can enable whitelist using the `/whitelist on` command in-game or via the server console (when in the console, don't include the slash!) and add players using the `/whitelist add <username>`.

3. Install an anti-scanner mod/plugin
  There are many mods/plugins available to protect your server from scanners.
  Servers running Fabric or Quilt can use the [Sneaky Server](https://modrinth.com/mod/sneaky-server) or [AntiScan](https://modrinth.com/mod/antiscan) mods (both available on Modrinth).
  Servers running Spigot derivatives (such as Paper or Purpur) can use the [KittyBlock](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/kittyblock.123679/) plugin (available on SpigotMC).

4. Install an anti-griefing/rollback plugin
  If you're concerned about players you've allowed to join your server griefing, you can install a plugin like [Prism (reccomended)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/prism.99397/updates) (available on SpigotMC) or [CoreProtect](https://modrinth.com/plugin/coreprotect) (available on Modrinth) which log and allow rollbacks of changes.
