You've spent hundreds of hours in Minecraft. It's a beautiful game, a digital canvas where you and your friends mine, craft, and bring incredible ideas to life, block by block. Maybe you've built a sprawling castle, a complex redstone machine, or even monumental cities that took months, years, of dedication.

How would you feel if you logged in one day and all of it was gone? Lavacasted to bits, burned to the ground, the TNT craters leaving your world in an irreparable state. All that hard work, destroyed by players who are now sharing screenshots of your ruined base in their private groups for clout, laughing at your loss.

# How do you find servers?
We don't actually run any "server scanning" programs! Griefing groups constantly use server scanners and their own Discord bots to form large databases, mapping entire online gaming servers in the span of hours. Since those already exist, in an ironic twist, we just tag along and use their databases and APIs for good, rather than for destructive purposes. 

# xxx joined my server. Was this you?
Our only Minecraft accounts currently in use are **Server_Protector**, **Whitelist_Check**, **PutOnWhitelist**

# What's with the skin?

Server_Protector's skin was one of our team members' first skin in Minecraft, dating back to 1.4.6.

# How can I protect my server?
If your server is meant to be private, there are a few things you can do.

1) Use online-mode

This is by far the most important protection mechanism. If your server is running in offline-mode, anyone can join with any username, including as an operator, even if whitelist is enabled. To stop this, you should set the server to online-mode. If you don't own a copy of the game and are able to purchase one, you can use the funds paying for your server to buy an account instead, and play multiplayer using a mod like [e4mc (reccomended)](https://modrinth.com/mod/e4mc) (available via modrinth) or [Essential (available via modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/essential) [or via their installer)](https://essential.gg/downloads). If you aren't able to purchase a copy of the game (e.g. due to sanctions in your country), you can use a plugin like [AuthMeReloaded](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authmereloaded.6269/) (available on SpigotMC), so players need to set a password and enter it every time they log on. This combined with a whitelist will stop malicious players from joining your server.

2) Enable whitelist

With a whitelist in place, only users admins manually add are able to join and play on the server. You can enable whitelist using the `/whitelist on` command in-game or via the server console (when in the console, don't include the slash!) and add players using the `/whitelist add <username>`.

3) Install an anti-scanner mod/plugin

There are many mods/plugins available to protect your server from scanners. Servers running Fabric or Quilt can use the [Sneaky Server](https://modrinth.com/mod/sneaky-server) or [AntiScan](https://modrinth.com/mod/antiscan) mods (both available on Modrinth). Servers running Spigot derivatives (such as Paper or Purpur) can use the [KittyBlock](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/kittyblock.123679/) plugin (available on SpigotMC).

4) Install an anti-griefing/rollback plugin

If you're concerned about players you've whitelisted griefing, you can install a plugin like [Prism (reccomended)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/prism.99397/updates) (available on SpigotMC) or [CoreProtect](https://modrinth.com/plugin/coreprotect) (available on Modrinth) which log and allow rollbacks of changes.

# Is this legal?

We are in full compliance with the Minecraft EULA, Minecraft Usage Guidelines, Xbox Community Standards, and all other relevant rules and regulations.

“To keep the Minecraft community welcoming and inclusive for everyone, we have a zero-tolerance policy towards hate speech, terrorist or violent extremist content, bullying, harassing, sexual solicitation, fraud, or threatening others.”

Griefing, harassment, and abuse have no place in Minecraft. Playing with others should be safe and inclusive, and we take action when that safety is threatened.

Content that involves hate speech, violent threats, harassment, bullying, sexual solicitation, fraud, or encouragement of illegal activity is strictly prohibited under Minecraft’s guidelines. Builds, mods, skins, and chat behavior that promote harm or extreme bias are also not allowed.

Despite this, so-called “renovation” groups like The Fifth Column and MLPI (which stands for "Mojang Loss Prevention Inc", even though its members have been banned from multiplayer by Mojang in the past) falsely claim to follow the EULA while openly violating it by harrasing and destroying random servers, often those of young players who don’t know how to protect them. These groups justify griefing as "education" or "stopping piracy". In reality, they’re trying to rank up in private Discords by destroying as many servers as possible, leaving behind signs with Discord invites, and mocking server owners. 

Our community focuses on education and awareness about these violations. We do not profit from these activities but act solely to promote fair play, protect builds, and prevent abuse before it causes harm.
