# Is this legal?

Yes, what we do is completely legal and within our rights as an anti-griefing group. We are in full compliance with the Minecraft EULA, Community Guidelines, and all relevant server rules and regulations.

“To keep the Minecraft community welcoming and inclusive for everyone, we have a zero-tolerance policy towards hate speech, terrorist or violent extremist content, bullying, harassing, sexual solicitation, fraud, or threatening others.”

Griefing, harassment, and abuse have no place in Minecraft. Playing with others should be safe and inclusive, and we take action when that safety is threatened.

Content that involves hate speech, violent threats, harassment, bullying, sexual solicitation, fraud, or encouragement of illegal activity is strictly prohibited under Minecraft’s guidelines. Builds, mods, skins, and chat behavior that promote harm or extreme bias are also not allowed.

Despite this, so-called “renovation” groups like MLPI and 5C falsely claim to follow the EULA while openly violating it using hacked clients, server scanners, to carry out harassment, and destruction, often targeting young players who don’t know how to protect their servers. These groups justify griefing as "education" but in reality, they’re farming ranks in private Discords by wrecking as many servers as possible, leaving behind signs with Discord invites, and mocking devastated server owners for laughs. 

Our community focuses on education and awareness about these violations. We do not profit from these activities - we act solely to promote fair play, protect builds, and prevent abuse before it causes harm.
